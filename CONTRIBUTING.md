Fix bugs or improve the codebase.
Add new data structures or algorithm implementations, Leetcode solutions, or any interview Questions.
Improve documentation and code readability.
Suggest new features related to DSA.
Please note that any code contribution must strictly adhere to the DSA and Problems theme of the project.

Reporting Bugs
If you find any bugs, please:

Search if an issue for the bug already exists.
If no such issue exists, [create a new issue](https://github.com/abhishektripathi66/DSA/issues).
Describe the problem clearly.
Include steps to reproduce the issue, if applicable.
Provide any relevant context or logs.
Feature Requests
For new features or enhancements, please open a [new feature request issue](https://github.com/abhishektripathi66/DSA/pulls). Describe:

The problem you're solving.

Code Contribution Guidelines
When contributing code, please follow these guidelines:

File Naming
Use descriptive names for files that clearly represent the data structure or algorithm implemented.
Example: BinarySearchTree.java, QuickSort.java
Coding Style
Follow standard Java conventions:
Use camelCase for variables and methods.
Use PascalCase for class names.
Avoid unnecessary comments, but document complex logic.
Indentation: 4 spaces, no tabs.
Limit each line to a maximum of 100 characters.
Ensure proper JavaDocs are included for all methods and classes.
Testing
Every new data structure or algorithm must have corresponding unit tests.
Use JUnit 5 (or specify if you prefer another testing framework).
Tests should cover edge cases and expected behavior.
Commit Messages
Use clear, concise commit messages:
Example: Added QuickSort algorithm with tests or Fixed issue in LinkedList implementation
If your commit relates to an open issue, reference the issue number.
Pull Request Process
Fork the repository and create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.

Branch naming convention: feature/algorithm-name or fix/issue-description
Make sure your changes do not break existing functionality.

Run all tests before submitting the PR.
Submit a pull request with:

A clear description of your changes.
References to relevant issues, if any.
